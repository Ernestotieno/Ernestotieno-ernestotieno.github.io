      <h2> Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am  a dedicated Statistician, Researcher, and Data Analyst passionate about transforming data into actionable insights for sustainable development. My expertise spans statistical analysis, predictive modeling, biostatistics, epidemiology, and data management, with proficiency in R,Python, SPSS, Microsoft Excel, and Word.

I specialize in time series analysis, survival analysis, Bayesian statistics, logistic regression, and multivariate analysis, and have hands-on experience in health and agricultural research, integrating both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. I am also skilled in data collection and management, including the use of KoboCollect and other digital tools for field data collection in healthcare and agricultural projects.

My work bridges the worlds of data science, AI, and sustainable development, focusing on real-world challenges in healthcare, agriculture, and the environment. I have designed and implemented AI-driven predictive models to analyze climate change impacts, optimize maize yield, assess healthcare accessibility, and evaluate public health outcomes.

I am committed to promoting data-driven decision-making that aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — particularly Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3), and Climate Action (SDG 13).
My goal is to leverage statistics, technology, and innovation to create measurable social impact and foster sustainable growth across Africa and beyond.
