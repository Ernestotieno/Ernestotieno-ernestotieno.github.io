      <h3>Epidemiological Dashboard for Monitoring and Modelling Malaria Incidence in Kenya</h3>
      <p>
        This interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes and models malaria incidence trends across Kenyan counties, providing valuable insights for public health monitoring and intervention planning.

The dashboard integrates multi-year malaria data with climate indicators such as rainfall and temperature, allowing users to explore relationships between environmental factors and malaria prevalence. It also incorporates ITN (Insecticide-Treated Net) coverage rates to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures.

Relevance:
This project supports Kenya’s National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) and aligns with SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being, by promoting data-driven disease surveillance and policy decision-making. The model’s findings can guide resource allocation, prevention strategies, and improve public health outcomes in malaria-endemic regions like Kisumu, Kakamega, and Homa Bay
